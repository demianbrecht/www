This is a static jekyll site. It is a personal landing page (demianbrecht.com), hosted on github pages.

The introduction should be built from my linkedin profile at https://www.linkedin.com/in/demianbrecht/.

There should be a recap of my 10 most recent blog posts. I have blogged on medium (@demianbrecht) and dev.to (https://forem.com/demianbrecht). Front end script should be written to dynamically pull articles from both and decide which to render. medium articles can be found at
https://medium.com/feed/@demianbrecht in xml format (will also require allorigins.win to skirt around cors requirements). dev.to apparently exposes an unauthenticated api for this.

The design should be clean and minimalistic. I'd like the header to resemble a basic terminal entry with a blinking cursor beside it (just with my name, Demian Brecht). I like the concept at https://lauryn-template.webflow.io/ as an example.
