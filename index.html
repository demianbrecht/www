<section class="intro">
  <p>
    I've been on a computer since the days of the Vic 20. I've been around code since BASIC as a kid. Geocities was where I hosted my first website,
    that glorious Diablo fan site. I started getting involved with the security scene with a local 2600 enthusiast groups in the late 90s
    and then settled into writing code professionally in the early 2000s. I started with a small business automation company, working with Visual Basic 6
    and an MS Access backend.
  </p>
  <p>
    After that, I spent over a decade in the gaming industry working on various aspects, from front end and gameplay to devops/automation to backend
    distributed systems. Many titles shipped over the years, many of which are listed on <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/142064/demian-brecht/">Moby Games</a>.
    During those years, I developed a passion for open source and the community around it. I was a contributing member of the Python Software Foundation,
    with contributed work mostly revolving around the all-but-defunct http module (who doesn't use requests or aiohttp these days?) and throwing
    my hat in the ring for two of the organizations working groups.
  <p>
    These days you can find me at Salesforce where I've been since 2015, working on Identity services. In my spare time,
    I'm keeping up on AI trends, downhill mountain biking, training, camping (mostly front country with the family) and
    <i>very infrequently</i> rock climbing.
