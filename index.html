  <p>
    A software engineer at Salesforce, based in British Columbia, Canada.
    I specialize in Python, backend systems and open source development with a focus
    on security, identity and automation. Polyglot as needed and have been known
    to write on occasion.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was a game developer in a previous life (ex-Demonware, Electronic Arts), working on various aspects
    from front end to gameplay and backend distributed systems.
  <p>
    Throughout my career, I've been an open source advocate and contributor. I was
    a contributing member of the Python Software Foundation, have contributed to the
    Python standard library and released multiple open source projects over the years.

  <p>
    Spare time activities include family craziness, keeping up on AI trends,
    downhill mountain biking, gym training, camping (back and front country) and
    <i>very infrequent</i> rock climbing.
