<section class="intro">
  <p>I’ve been on a computer since the days of the VIC-20, writing code since learning BASIC as a kid. I hosted my first website on GeoCities and got pulled into the security scene through a local <a href="https://www.2600.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2600</a> group in the late ’90s.</p>  

  <p>I began coding professionally in the early 2000s at a small business automation company, working with VB6 and an MS Access backend. From there, I spent over a decade in the gaming industry building everything from front-end and gameplay systems to DevOps/automation and backend distributed services, shipping multiple titles (many listed on <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/142064/demian-brecht/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MobyGames</a>).</p>

  <p>Along the way I developed a deep appreciation for open source and the communities that sustain it. I contributed to the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python Software Foundation</a>, mostly around the (now mostly historical) <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http</a> module, and participated in two PSF working groups.</p>

  <p>These days, you’ll find me at <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Salesforce</a> (since 2015), working on Identity services and large-scale distributed systems. Outside of work I’m usually chasing the next AI trend, downhill mountain biking, training, camping with the family, and occasionally rock climbing.</p>
